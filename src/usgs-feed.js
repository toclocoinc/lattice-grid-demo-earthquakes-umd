/**
 * The USGS earthquake feeds: fetching them, turning a GeoJSON feature into a
 * flat row, and polling for changes.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about the grid. It produces plain objects and hands them
 * to whoever asked, so the same code feeds the live page and the saved copy.
 *
 * The feeds are public and need no key. Each one is regenerated every minute.
 *
 * This is a classic script, not a module: there is no `import` or `export`
 * anywhere on this page. What this file offers is put on `QuakeDemo`, a
 * plain object on the global, and the next script reads it from there. The
 * snapshot tool runs this same file under Node, which is why it looks for
 * `globalThis` rather than `window`.
